By: LIU YUHAO

This project contains, one kivy file, six python files and three working files consisting of csv files, books.csv is the file for your use, books_backup.csv is the same data, but cannot be used... ...it's here as a backup from which to copy data if you ever need it again.

Edit this README file, replacing the instructions (including this paragraph) with your own assignment details.
At the end of the project, complete the very brief project reflection below by answering the questions (replace the answer... parts).
Note: If you use the free WakaTime service on your own machine, you can track exactly how long you spent in code.

How long did the entire project (assignment 2) take you?
For the entire ass2 project, I spent nearly two weeks to complete all my projects. 
When the main folder was running, I found some small problems. Later, I found that a small plugin of pythoncharm was not downloaded.
